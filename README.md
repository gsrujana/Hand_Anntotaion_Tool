# Hand_Anntotaion_Tool
Matlab Tool Box to annotate hand keypoints in video files

We have used this toolkit to annotate our Hand Keypoints Dataset (HKD) which can be found at http://vlm1.uta.edu/~srujana/HandPoseDataset/HK_Dataset.html.

This toolbox can be used to annotate 6 Keypoint locations on the hand namely - Wrist, Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring and Little finger tips. 
There are original images 640 X 480 and zoomed in cropped images 257 x 257. 

Steps: 1.) Browse to find .avi file 
2.) Use scroll bar to scroll to desired frame
3.) Click on option to select hand centroid - Allows to click on centroid of hand in the image. This zooms into a 257 X 257 region for the hand.
4.) Select buttons to annotate each of the 6 keypoints. (Click on the button and then click on the image.
5.) Click save. 
This saves original image file and allows to zooms in to crop and annotate hands and also saves cropped image. 
Annotations are saved for cropped and also saves translated annotations for original image.
